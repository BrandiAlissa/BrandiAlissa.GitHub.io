title: Style Lab

This is my **second post**.

The world is bleak and I have little understanding of the path laid out before me. I have connected links as well as labs to my current adventure but I can not continue 
with practical actions. I have every right to know how HTML works and yet it alludes me everytime I try to comprehend something that I did not find in my mind previously.
This is the ultimate travesty. I think style works a certain way and I can see it when I inspect the lab on my GitHub account but I can not access because I don't quite understand
how a style sheet relates to the other ones. I feel as if the data to the website is scattered everywhere and there is no way of connected it in my mind. It is a mess and I feel
like I myself am in the code unable to release myself from 1s and 0s. If I figure this out anytime soon I shall update my valiant readers but at this very moment at 3:03 PM on a 
Monday I feel no hope for my future.
